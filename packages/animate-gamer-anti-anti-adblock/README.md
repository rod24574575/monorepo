# Animate-Gamer Anti-Anti-AdBlock

Suppress the anti-AdBlock alert dialog in Animate-Gamer for the payed.

## TL;DR

I really don't want to write the anti-AdBlock user-script for such a conscious company, but the anti-AdBlock alert dialog is sometimes still popping up even if I have payed for the premium account and disabled AdBlock. At least I could choose not to publish it to any public user-script repository.

## Install

You can get this user-script from:
