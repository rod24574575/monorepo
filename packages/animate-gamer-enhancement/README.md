# Animate-Gamer Enhancement

Some user experience enhancement and small features for [Animate-Gamer](https://ani.gamer.com.tw/).

## Features

![Ui Preview](https://github.com/rod24574575/monorepo/raw/animate-gamer-enhancement-v1.1.1/packages/animate-gamer-enhancement/ui_preview.png)

- Automatically agree the content-rating screen.
  - A content-rating (also known as maturity-rating) screen would appear before you watch any videos. This script would agree it as soon as it appears, so you wouldn't even notice that this screen has appeared before.
- Automatically play the next episode.
  - Unlike the feature of the origin site, this script provides the flexibility to adjust the delay time.
  - **Be careful that this feature conflicts with the feature of the origin site. Please avoid enabling both at the same time.**
- Add some useful shortcuts.
  - `PageUp` for playing previous episode
  - `PageDown` for playing next episode
- Automation rules for timeline.
  - Allow you to set the automation rules at any time point. These rules would be triggered when the video reaches the time point.
